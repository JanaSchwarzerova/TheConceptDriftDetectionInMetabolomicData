# The Concept Drift Detection In Metabolomic Data

The prediction models with large potential in the future are based on biomedical data, especially model-based approach of prediction from metabolite datasets. These models will lead to early disease detection that will be useful for a milder course of the disease and less financial cost to treatment. Moreover, the current scientist challenges the move toward analysis and insight of phenotype-genotype relationship. This understanding leads over the examination and prediction of metabolites changes. The corrected tools for the creation of prediction models have to include the self-healing algorithm preventing the unwanted effects such as concept drift.

The main goal of this scripts include new challenge as different perspective on the analysis of metabolomics datasets using the concept drift detection. The evaluation includes two main approaches. The first approach is connected to the concept drift detection in available metabolomics datasets and the second approach is to provide the assessment of commonly used tools, resulting in the best detection approach for a general metabolomics dataset.

Thanks to that, this study brings the first insight on detection of concept drift in metabolite data. Although the results in determining drift are not unambiguous, and the further analysis is needed on larger datasets, the concept of drift detection has been confirmed. The metabolite data are affected by the concept drift like in financial credit applications. Thanks to that, the innovated adaptivity approach for the prediction should be used with caution. The study brings the first insight to detection the concept drift in metabolomic dataset, the detection drift in two different metabolite experiments, and evaluation of use on available datasets. The study opens new paths for next steps in using the correction algorithm connected with the concept drift analysis in metabolomic prediction.

The metabolomic data used in this study for concept drift detection analysis is taken from [30], see Datasets file.
